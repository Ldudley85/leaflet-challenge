Module 15 - Mapping Earthquake Data with Leaflet

This activity uses Leaflet to visualize an earthquake dataset from the USGS using a geoJSON feed. Multiple datasets are available at https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

This Leaflet map plots all the earthquakes from the past 7 days based on their longitude and latitude. 

Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.

Popups provide additional information (location, magnitude, and depth) about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

The legend shows the colors associated with the earthquake depths.

The Choropleth Map Tutorial on the Leaflet website provided significant guidance in creating the color scale and legend, as well as the necessary updates to the style.css file https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/
